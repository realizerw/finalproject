            <h4><b>About us</b></h4>
            <p>At Assumption Kindergarten School, we aim to foster a positive, stimulating environment that inspires and enables the holistic development of each child under our care. Our fun, safe and welcoming environment can help your child reach their
                full potential academically, socially and emotionally. Assumption Kindergarten School is a school for children of age 1.5 – 5 years. The school is located in the central business district in Bangkok, Sukhumvit Soi 26. It is just a few
                steps away from Funarium, K-village, Big-C Supermarket, Emporium Shopping center and many more residential buildings. We are proud of our purpose-built school, which has been designed with children’s safety and welfare as our utmost priority.
                Our purpose-built campus allows us to provide our children with plenty of natural light, spacious, beautifully decorated classrooms. The school is also equipped with quality resources, including toys, books and teaching materials to support
                and encourage children’s’ development and learning. There is a large outdoor green area that allows children to play, enjoy and explore nature. Assumption Kindergarten School is an Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) school. Our Head of
                School is an EYFS educator and administrator with long experience in London and Bangkok. She has created an excellent team of educators, who are fully experienced and have all been formally trained on child safety and welfare. We are positively
                sure that we can ensure that your child’s first educational experiences are happy, active, exciting, fun and secure, whilst their development, care and learning needs are all fully supported.</p>

                <h4><b>Our Philosophy</b></h4>
                <p>We believe that each child is unique and, that by personalising instruction to meet each child’s individual needs, we can enable them to thrive and unleash their full potential.</p>
                <p>We believe that child-led inquiry and play-based learning opportunities are vital to encourage children’s development; enabling them to make sense of their world.</p>
                <p>We believe in exploring children’s passions and curiosities and enabling provisions to be made for active and heuristic learning experiences.</p>
                <p>We believe in providing a safe, supportive and welcoming environment, where our classrooms are enriched with playful inquiry. Your child will also have regular access to stimulating outdoor learning opportunities.</p>
                <p>We believe in the importance of providing physical, social and emotional guidance to educate your child holistically.</p>
                <p>We believe in open communication with parents and encourage close collaboration between home and school to inspire and expand your child’s experiences and development.</p>
                <p>We believe in nurturing the qualities of equality, diversity, inclusion and respect for all.</p>
